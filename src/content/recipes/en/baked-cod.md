## Method

### Prepare the Base

Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). In a baking dish, combine cherry tomatoes, garlic, capers, half the herbs, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and white wine. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.

### Cook the Fish

Pat the cod fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. Place them on top of the tomato mixture. Drizzle with remaining olive oil and place lemon slices on top. Sprinkle with remaining herbs.

### Bake and Serve

Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is cooked through. The tomatoes should be burst and juicy. Serve hot, garnished with extra fresh herbs and lemon wedges, alongside crusty bread or steamed vegetables.
