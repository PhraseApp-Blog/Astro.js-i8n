## Method

### Prepare the Base

Heat butter and oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8-10 minutes.

### Make the Sauce

Sprinkle flour over the mushroom mixture and stir for 1 minute. Add paprika and stir. Gradually add the vegetable stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken. Stir in the Dijon mustard.

### Finish and Serve

Remove pan from heat and stir in the sour cream until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve over cooked egg noodles and garnish with fresh parsley.
