## Method

### Prepare the Topping

Mix diced tomatoes, minced garlic, and chopped basil in a bowl. Add olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for at least 15 minutes to marinate.

### Toast the Bread

Preheat grill or broiler. Brush bread slices with olive oil on both sides. Toast until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per side. Rub each slice with the cut side of the garlic clove.

### Serve

Top each bread slice with the tomato mixture just before serving. Drizzle with additional olive oil if desired.
