## Method

### Prepare the Bread

Toast or grill the bread slices until golden brown on both sides. While still warm, lightly rub one side of each slice with a peeled garlic clove.

### Add Tomato

Cut the tomatoes in half and rub them firmly against the garlic-rubbed side of the bread, letting the pulp and juice soak in. Discard the tomato skins.

### Finish and Serve

Drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Serve immediately while the bread is still warm.
