## Method

### Cook the Dal

Wash the lentils thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium pot, combine the lentils, water, turmeric powder, and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface. Cook for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are soft and begin to break down. Add more water if needed to maintain a soup-like consistency. Once cooked, mash the dal slightly with the back of a spoon for a smoother texture. Keep warm.

### Prepare the Tarka (Tempering)

Heat the ghee or oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds. When they start to splutter, add the garlic and onion. Sauté until the onion is golden brown and the garlic is fragrant. Add the green chilies (if using), garam masala, chili powder, and tomato. Cook until the tomato softens and breaks down into the mixture.

### Combine and Serve

Pour the prepared tarka over the cooked dal. Stir well to combine and let the flavors meld for a few minutes on low heat. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice, naan, or chapati.
