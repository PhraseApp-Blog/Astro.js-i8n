## Method

### Prepare the Chocolate

Chop the chocolate and melt it gently in a bowl over simmering water (bain-marie). Once melted, let it cool slightly but remain fluid.

### Make the Base

Whip the cream with vanilla until soft peaks form. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until foamy, then gradually add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.

### Combine and Chill

Stir egg yolks into the melted chocolate. Fold in whipped cream gently, then fold in egg whites in three additions. Divide between serving glasses and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

### Serve

Top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings before serving.
