## Method

### Prepare the Base

Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Arrange tortilla chips in an overlapping layer on a large baking sheet or ovenproof dish. Sprinkle evenly with both types of cheese.

### Add Toppings

Scatter black beans, diced tomatoes, chopped onion, and jalapeños over the cheese layer.

### Bake and Serve

Bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese is completely melted and bubbling. Remove from oven and immediately garnish with fresh coriander. Serve hot with sour cream, guacamole, and hot sauce on the side.
