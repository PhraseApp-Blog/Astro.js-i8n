## Method

### Make the Dough

Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Add flour all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a smooth ball, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 5 minutes.

### Add Eggs and Cheese

Beat in eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in most of the cheese (reserve some for topping), salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

### Bake

Pipe or spoon small mounds onto baking sheets. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 200°C (400°F) for 20-25 minutes until golden and puffed. Serve warm.
