## Method

### Prepare the Layers

Make up the jelly according to packet instructions and let it cool but not set. Layer sponge pieces in the base of a glass bowl, sprinkle with sherry or juice. Add berries, then pour over the cooled jelly. Refrigerate until set.

### Add Custard Layer

Once jelly is set, pour over the custard in an even layer. Return to fridge for 1 hour.

### Finish and Decorate

Whip cream with sugar until soft peaks form. Spread over the custard layer. Decorate with toasted almonds and any remaining berries. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
