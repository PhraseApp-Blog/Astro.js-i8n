## Method

### Prepare the Base

Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Add all the spices and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

### Make the Curry

Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Add chickpeas and coconut milk, bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add spinach in batches, stirring until wilted.

### Finish and Serve

Season with salt to taste. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to let the flavors meld. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot with rice or naan bread.
