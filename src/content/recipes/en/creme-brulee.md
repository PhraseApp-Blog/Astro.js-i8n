## Method

### Make the Custard

Heat cream with split vanilla pod until almost boiling. Remove from heat and let infuse for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt until pale. Remove vanilla pod from cream, scraping out seeds back into the cream. Slowly whisk warm cream into egg mixture.

### Bake

Pour mixture into ramekins. Place in a deep baking tray and fill with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake at 150°C (300°F) for about 30 minutes until just set with a slight wobble. Chill for at least 4 hours.

### Caramelize

Just before serving, sprinkle each custard with a thin layer of sugar. Caramelize with a blowtorch or under a very hot grill until golden and crisp. Let stand for 2 minutes before serving.
